        <h2>What is LadybugDB?</h2>
        <p>
            LadybugDB is a modern graph database designed with a primary focus on <strong>object storage</strong>.
            Unlike traditional databases that treat storage as an afterthought, LadybugDB places object storage
            at the core of its architecture, enabling efficient management of complex, interconnected data structures
            while maintaining the flexibility and scalability that modern applications demand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Built on top of <strong>KuzuDB</strong>, LadybugDB inherits a robust and modular implementation of <a href="https://kuzudb.com/docs/developer-guide/database-internal/">cypher</a>.
            KuzuDB was previously developed by KÃ¹zu Inc.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Separation of Compute and Storage Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Every modern database needs to consider the <strong>separation of compute and storage</strong> as a
            fundamental architectural principle. This concept is no longer optional but essential for building
            scalable, cost-effective data systems.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Key Benefits of Compute-Storage Separation:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Independent Scaling:</strong> Scale compute resources for query processing separately
                from storage capacity, optimizing costs and performance based on actual workload demands.</li>

                <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Store massive amounts of data cheaply in object storage
                (like S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage) while only paying for compute resources
                when actively processing queries.</li>

                <li><strong>Elasticity:</strong> Spin up multiple compute nodes to handle peak loads and scale
                them down during quiet periods, all while accessing the same persistent data layer.</li>

                <!--
                <li><strong>Durability and Availability:</strong> Leverage cloud object storage's built-in
                redundancy, replication, and disaster recovery capabilities without implementing these complex
                features in the database layer.</li>

                <li><strong>Multi-tenant Efficiency:</strong> Multiple database instances or workloads can share
                the same storage layer, each with their own compute resources, reducing data duplication and
                management overhead.</li>

                <li><strong>Operational Simplicity:</strong> Simplify backup, recovery, and data lifecycle
                management by delegating storage concerns to proven object storage systems.</li>
                -->
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
            By embracing this architectural pattern, LadybugDB enables organizations to build data systems that
            can grow seamlessly from prototype to production, handling everything from small datasets to petabyte-scale
            graph data without requiring fundamental architectural changes.
        </p>

        <h2>Object Storage at the Core</h2>
        <p>
            LadybugDB's focus on object storage means it's designed from the ground up to work efficiently with
            cloud-native storage systems. This approach aligns perfectly with modern cloud architectures where
            object storage provides unlimited scalability, high durability, and cost-effective long-term data retention.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you're building knowledge graphs, recommendation systems, fraud detection networks, or social
            network analytics, LadybugDB provides the graph database capabilities you need while ensuring your
            data architecture remains flexible and future-proof.
